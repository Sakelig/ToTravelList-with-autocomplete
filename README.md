## TODO
A) Text-field should have auto-complete
* [x] List of countries can be fetched async from https://restcountries.eu (note: used .com instead)
* [ ] Countries already added to the list should not be shown in the autocomplete
* [ ] User should only be able to add legit country names (same behaviour as expected in
the to/from field on e.g. https://vy.no)

B) Revisiting users should be able to load back their list from the day before
