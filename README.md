## TODO
A) Text-field should have auto-complete
* [x] List of countries can be fetched async from https://restcountries.eu (note: used .com instead)
* [x] Countries already added to the list should not be shown in the 
  autocomplete 
* [x] User should only be able to add legit country names (same behaviour as 
  expected in
the to/from field on e.g. https://vy.no) (note: gives alert if not legit)

B) Revisiting users should be able to load back their list from the day before

EXTRAS:
* [x] Button to remove from the list now works
* [x] Button to toggle completed/not completed now works
